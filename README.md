## Hi, I'm Sonia Matysiak 👋


🛡️ **Cybersecurity Junior | SOC & SIEM**  
📍 Warsaw, Poland

I'm a cybersecurity junior starting my journey in **SOC**, exploring the world of **SIEMs**, alerts, and logs that (apparently) say more than meets the eye.

I create my own **projects**, test new tools, break things into smaller pieces, and try to understand cybersecurity in a **human, logical way** — not only *how* things work, but *why*.

I learn fast, use my imagination, and I’m not afraid to experiment (even if something occasionally catches fire 🔥).

🎓 Studying **Cybersecurity at PJATK (Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology) in Warsaw**  
⏱️ After hours:
- 🧩 Solving rooms on **TryHackMe**
- 🎥 Learning from **YouTube** (CTF, SOC, Incident Response)
- 🧠 Turning theory into practice

📈 *Still learning, still curious — one alert at a time.*
